          Mohammed is a dedicated entrepreneur, community builder, and proud

            His journey with Bosnia began during the war when he arrived on a
            humanitarian mission to provide essential aid and support. After the
            war, he returned to Egypt but felt a deep connection to Bosnia.
            Thirteen years ago, he made the decision to move back permanently
            and has since played a vital role in the local business community.

            With a keen eye for business and a passion for helping others,
            Mohammed has successfully established a restaurant, farm, factory,
            and multiple businessesâ€”both for himself and for friends. His
            expertise extends beyond entrepreneurship; over the years, he has
            gained extensive experience in visa processes and legal procedures,
            building a strong network of connections.

            Mohammed has personally helped five families secure visas, enroll
            their children in schools and universities, find housing, and settle
            into life in Bosnia. His love for this country drives him to welcome
            and support expats, ensuring they experience Bosnia as fully and
            joyfully as he does.
